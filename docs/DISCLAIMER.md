## The Nature of Randomness

The **Preloto** project is a scientific exploration of probability and statistical modeling applied to lottery games. It is critical to understand the following principles:

1. **Independent Trials**: For most lottery games (like Mega Sena using physical balls), each draw is statistically independent of the previous ones. The probability of any specific number being drawn remains constant (1/60 for Mega Sena) regardless of its history.
2. **Gambler's Fallacy**: The belief that a number is "due" because it hasn't appeared in a long time is a cognitive bias. The `GapModel` explores this heuristic but carries no mathematical guarantee of success.
3. **Hot Hand Fallacy**: The belief that a number is "hot" because it appeared recently is another bias. The `SurfingModel` explores clustering variance but does not predict future mechanical outcomes.

## Purpose of Models

The models provided (`gap`, `surfing`, `frequency`) are **heuristics** designed to:

* Explore statistical variance in finite datasets.
* Test hypotheses about non-uniformity in physical randomization devices (if any exist).
* Provide deterministic ways to generate bets, avoiding human biases (like picking birthdays).

## No Guarantees

**Preloto makes no claims of increasing your odds of winning.** All predictions are for educational and research purposes only.
