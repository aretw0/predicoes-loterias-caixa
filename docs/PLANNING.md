# Planning & Roadmap

## Versioning Strategy

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer).

* **Current Version**: `0.1.0`

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 - Foundation (Current)

* [x] Robust CLI (`preloto`)
* [x] Deterministic Models (`seed`, sorting)
* [x] Automated Testing Infrastructure
* [x] Documentation Restructure
* [x] Editable Install Support

### v0.2.0 - Model Research & Expansion (Next)

* [ ] **Research**: Study statistical distributions (e.g., Law of Large Numbers, Poisson) to identify potential "surfing" strategies.
* [ ] **New Models**: Implement models based on research (e.g., avoiding unlikely sequences).
* [ ] **Academic Integrity**: Ensure all new models have a clear mathematical basis, acknowledging the stochastic nature of the game.
* [ ] Advanced statistical filters.
* [ ] Machine Learning implementations (if proven viable in analysis).

### v0.3.0 - Future & Integration

* [ ] "Hypothetical P&L": Tracking theoretical performance over time.
* [ ] External Tools: Integration with analysis pipelines.

## Future Ideas

* **Web Interface**: A static site generating daily predictions.
* **Backtesting Engine**: Simulate strategies over past years.
